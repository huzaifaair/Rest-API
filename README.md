A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications. It is based on a stateless, client-server communication model that uses HTTP as the underlying protocol. REST APIs are used to allow different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet, often through standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Resources in a REST API are typically represented as URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and can be accessed using HTTP methods such as GET (to retrieve data), POST (to create data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove data).

One of the key features of REST APIs is that they are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. This ensures scalability and simplicity, as the server does not need to remember the state of previous interactions. Responses are typically formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML, making them easily readable and understood by both humans and machines. REST APIs are known for their flexibility and lightweight nature, allowing developers to build applications that can interact with each other across different platforms and technologies.
